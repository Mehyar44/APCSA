# FRQ 2
## About:
- Creating the class `Scoreboard` which consists of three methods.
- The methods are the constructor `recordPlay` and `getScore`.
## Struggles:
- Knowing whose turn is it.
- To solve this I created a boolean variable called `isTeamOne`.
## Helpful Prior Experiences:
- Learning to concatenate.
- Learning how to create classes.
## What I Learned:
- You can use boolean = !boolean to switch the state of the variable.
