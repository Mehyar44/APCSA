# FRQ 1
## About:
- Creating the methods `simulateOneDay(int numBirds)` and `simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays)`.
- `simulateOneDay(int numBirds)` does a simulation where birds or a bear eat from a feeder for one day.
- `simulateManyDays(int numBirds, int numDays)` does multiple simulations by calling `simulateOneDay(int numBirds)`.
## Struggles:
- Using a for loop to solve the question.
- A while loop would have worked better.
## Helpful Prior Experiences:
- Learning how to use `math.random()`.
- Learning how a for loop works.
## What I Learned:
- The first `math.random()` to test for a bear could have been more simpler.
- It could have been a 1 in 20 instead of 5 in 100.
